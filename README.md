### Command-line pastebin (pastebincl)
*by Théophile BASTIAN (a.k.a. Tobast) / [Website](http://tobast.fr)*

This is a fork from the main pastebincl repository ([here](https://gitorious.org/command-line-pastebin/command-line-pastebin)).
The main git site has been archived, and is currently read-only.

This repository aims to update the original program by Théophile, possibly adding new features in future.
